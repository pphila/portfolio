    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>My names is Peter, I was born in <strong>Thailand</strong>. My family came to Portland when I was only a baby. I grew up on the west side of Portland, near the <em>Beaverton/Hillsboro</em> border. As for education I have a Bachelor's degree in <u>Biology</u>. I have worked many various jobs, from laborer and machine operator in a factory, Wholefoods market teammember, Certified Nursing Assistant in a nursing home and hospital, and currently am still working at OHSU as a Head Unit Coordinator. Which is just a fancy title for a unit secratary.</p>
        <p>I chose to enroll into this programming bootcamp because after working in the hospital setting throughout the pandemic really cemented that the medical career path was not for me. Though I still love learning about medicine, the real world aspect of the enduring abuse from patients, dealing with the rampant medical illiteracy, and outright disregard scientific fact has accelerated the feeling of burnout. Understanding that getting into a medical school is still quite a ways out and the expense of applications aswell as the realization that any medical school is expensive, I chose to embark onto this career path instead.</p>
      <h3>Current Hobbies And Interest</h3>
        <p>I have many hobbies as one does living in the beautiful Pacific Northewest, here is a list of of a few things and activities I enjoy.</p>
